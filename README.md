Hey! My name is potato, and welcome to my github page!

Here's my [full bio](https://potato.is-a-kitty.cat/bio) btw

Most repositories here are old projects I've decided to host here, and some of these are still (technically) mantained :p

If you have any doubts/suggestions, be sure to let me know through Discord (my username is `papaproductions`)!
